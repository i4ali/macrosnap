# Screen 4: Settings

This screen handles goals, Pro status, and other app settings.

## "The Standard List"

This uses a classic, native iOS grouped list.

## Design Rationale

- **Familiar**: Instantly recognizable to any iOS user.
- **Account Management**: Shows signed-in status and provides easy access to account details and sign-out option.
- **Clear Upsell**: The Pro banner is the first item. The "Pro Features" section clearly shows what is currently locked.
- **Simple**: Easy to navigate. "Daily Goals" would lead to a simple screen with 3 number-entry fields.
- **Goals Explained**:
  - **Free**: Set one standard goal (e.g., 180P/250C/70F) that applies every day
  - **Pro**: Set different goals for different days (e.g., high carbs on training days, lower on rest days - perfect for carb cycling and training splits)
- **Sync Built-In**: All users get automatic cloud sync via Supabase - no need for a separate toggle or Pro feature
- **Guest Mode**: In guest mode, ACCOUNT section is replaced with a sign-up CTA banner. Tapping any setting shows "Create Account to Continue" prompt
