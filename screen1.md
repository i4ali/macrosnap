## Design Rationale

- **Visual**: The rings provide a quick, glanceable status.
- **Native Feel**: Looks and feels like a native Apple app.
- **Clear Data**: The bars below the rings give exact gram counts for users who want precision.
- **Fast Action**: A large, floating "+" button is the primary call to action, leading directly to the "Quick Log" screen.
- **Data Sync**: All data is automatically synced via iCloud to the user's devices.
