## **Risk Mitigation**

- **Low Pro conversion**: A/B test pricing, add more Pro value
- **Competitor copies**: Move fast, maintain quality, build loyal user base

---

## **Principles**

Throughout all phases, maintain these core principles:

1. **Speed First**: Every feature must be fast. No loading spinners if avoidable.
2. **No Bloat**: Say no to features that don't serve the core use case.
3. **Native Feel**: iOS conventions over custom designs.
4. **Privacy Always**: No tracking, no data selling, minimal analytics.
5. **One Thing Well**: Macro tracking. Not exercise. Not recipes. Just macros.

**Target Launch**: Q1 2026 (13 weeks from start)
