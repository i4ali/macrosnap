# Screen 2: Quick Log (Modal Sheet)

This screen slides up from the bottom when the user taps the "+" button. Speed is the #1 priority.

## "The Numeric Keypad"

This design uses a dedicated keypad, removing the need for the system keyboard.

## Design Rationale

- **Fastest Entry**: No keyboard load time. Tapping a field focuses it, and the user just types. "Done" logs the entry.
- **Focused**: The UI is only about number entry.
- **Pro Upsell**: Clearly shows the value of "Notes" and "Presets" for Pro users.
