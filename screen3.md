## Design Rationale

- **Free**: Fully functional for 7 days, showing the core value.
- **Pro**: The calendar view becomes fully scrollable, and tapping a day shows its stats. Tapping the title ("History") could toggle to Week/Month chart views (a Pro feature).
- **Intuitive**: Everyone knows how to use a calendar.
- **Guest Mode**: Shows demo historical data (7 days of sample entries) to demonstrate functionality. Tapping on any day shows "Sign Up to Track Your Macros" prompt.
